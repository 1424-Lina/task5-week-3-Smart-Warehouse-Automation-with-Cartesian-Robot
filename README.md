# task5-week-3-Smart-Warehouse-Automation-with-Cartesian-Robot
This task focuses on the development of a smart, fully automated warehouse system using a Cartesian robot capable of performing all item-handling tasks without any human intervention.

The robot is designed to operate along three axes (X, Y, Z) and is equipped with a vertical arm (Z-axis) and an end-effector (gripper). It retrieves items that slide down angled shelves and transports them to a designated delivery zone, such as a conveyor or drop-off bin.

The operation algorithm allows the robot to:
	•	Initialize and self-calibrate.
	•	Receive orders from a Warehouse Management System (WMS).
	•	Locate and access parts autonomously.
	•	Pick and deliver items precisely and efficiently.
